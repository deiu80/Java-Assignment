# Java-Assignment
This is an assignment part of the OOP module i had in the first year of uni. It is about projecting the world map given the a file with coordinates and altitudes. The map can be clicked to calculate distance between 2 points and also delete the last point from a list of coordinates that is stored in the coordinates.txt created file.
